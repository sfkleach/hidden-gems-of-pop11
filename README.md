# The Hidden Gems of Pop-11

This is a repository for a scheduled on-line talk for [CodeHub Bristol](https://codehub.org.uk)
which will highlight some of the areas of Pop-11 that remain noteworthy in
one way or another. If you are interested in our talks or what we do, please
join our Discord channel.

The section below was used to advertise the talk - please note that some
historical simplifications are made (e.g. no mention of COWSEL) in the
interest of making it short and sweet.

## Flyer for Decodering - Tue 21st Jan, 18:30-20:00

The first high-level programming languages were created in 1959-1960 and
kick-started a period of explosive experimentation in programming language
design. Within six years there was an incredible diversity of languages -
FORTRAN, Lisp, Algol-60, COBOL, Simula, SNOBOL and APL. And barely noticed
outside of Edinburgh University Dept of Machine Intelligence, Pop-1, the
progenitor of the Pop-family of programming languages, arrived. 

In this Decodering, I will be talking about its ancestor, Pop-11. Pop-11 is the
most evolved and mature member of this fascinating family of languages and in
its heyday (1980-1990) it was a significant part of the British AI scene. This
family is characterised by its use of an open stack for passing arguments,
higher-order functions, garbage collection and Algol-like syntax.

Although Pop-11's star has long since faded, it remains an exceptional
accomplishment with many Hidden Gems. In this talk I will be spotlighting some
of the features of this amazing language - those that still outstrip today's
programming languages or are simply mind-boggling. Anyone who is interested in
different approaches to programming languages or just the history of British
computing should tune in.
